Chuan Ordinance:
<br>
The purpose of the game play is not fighting, so only like-minded people 
to participate. Not the small number of rows of 5 or more ... 
should be enough. Sandro!
<br>
(grade 3 or higher in the clan for the clan chief and team 
captain and at least 5 or more teams to participate.)
