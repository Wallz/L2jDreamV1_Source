Guard Emdrere:
<br>
Halt!
<br>
Welcome to the Town of Oren.
<br>
Even in our fair city, there are several dangerous areas -- for your 
safety, ask before you venture blindly into a hazardous situation.
<br>
There isn't anything dangerous to the west, fortunately.
<br>
The Elven Forest, home to all the Elves, lies not too far away.
<br>
I hear it's beautiful.
<br>
I'd even like to visit it sometime.
<br>
However, the Dragon Claw Mountains lie between Oren and the Elven Forest, 
so even though the distance isn't great, traveling there isn't easy.
