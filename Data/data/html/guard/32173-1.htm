Zerstorer Marcela:
<br>
Long ago, the Kamael were called Marksmen, and their commanders were called Zerstorers.
<br>
Ah, but that was when all Kamael were warriors.
<br>
Now, of course, we have a village, and there are civilians among us.
<br>
So gradually the Marksmen became the keepers of law, and the Zerstorers became the keepers of justice.
